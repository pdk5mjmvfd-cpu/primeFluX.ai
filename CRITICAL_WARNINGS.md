# ⭐ 11th-Man Critical Warnings for ApopAI v3

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: These Rules Must NEVER Be Violated

### 1. Do NOT Merge Identities, Ever

**Each Apop instance is separate.**
**Each user is separate.**
**Each agent is separate.**
**Each repo is separate.**

**No automatic merging, flattening, or collapsing of:**
- distinctions
- histories
- branches
- agent states
- contexts

**Identity collapse = system death.**

### 2. Do NOT Let Measurement Be Treated as Information Loss

**You must enforce the conceptual patch:**

```
Measurement creates error.
Error creates new distinction.
Distinction creates flux.
Flux expands information.
```

**Cursor must never reintroduce classical measurement collapse logic.**

### 3. Do NOT Allow Any System to Rewrite or Delete the Commit Chain

**Git history is the PF distinction-chain.**

**No rebases**
**No history compression**
**No forced pushes**
**No amend-overwrites**

**All pushes must be append-only.**

This is the same rule as "identity cannot be overwritten."

### 4. Do NOT Allow Agents to Mutate Each Other's Internal States

**Agents communicate via capsules, not modification.**

**Agents can:**
- read each other
- send to each other's inbox
- respond to flux

**They cannot:**
- modify another agent's directory
- alter another agent's memory
- rewrite another agent's code
- collapse another agent's shell state

### 5. Do NOT Invoke External LLMs in a Way That Allows Them to Override Apop

**Atlas, Claude, Comet must be treated as:**
- external curvature fields, never internal operators
- They contribute flux, not identity

### 6. Do NOT Allow Supervisor to Force Collapse Without PF Justification

**Shell transition to 4 must only occur when:**
- curvature stabilizes
- flux amplitude drops
- combinatorics settle
- triplet structure converges

**Never hard collapse.**

### 7. Do NOT Treat Error as a Failure

**Error = signal**
**Error = curvature**
**Error = distinction engine**

**Cursor must never prune "error" unless explicitly told.**

### 8. Do NOT Build a Monolithic Runtime

**Apop is recursive, modular, and distributed.**

**A single "controller" breaks the system logic.**

### 9. Do NOT Optimize Away Distinctions

**Code optimizers will try to compress logic.**
**We want the opposite.**

**Distinctions = memory = identity.**

### 10. Do NOT Allow Any Code to Auto-Delete Capsules

**Capsules are events in a PF chain.**
**Deletion = loss of identity continuity.**

## 🏗️ Architectural Principles

### 1. The Repo is the PF Manifold

**Cursor must treat repo structure as:**
- triplet space
- shell structure
- curvature layer
- flux memory
- distinction lattice

**Not as "just files."**

### 2. The LCM is the Brain

**Cursor must not distribute LCM logic.**
**All thinking = LCM.**

### 3. The ICM is the Curvature

**All PF math goes in ICM.**
**ICM must remain a distinct module.**

### 4. Supervisor is the Routing Field

**Supervisor = the PF curvature router**
**NOT a command executor.**

### 5. Agents are Cognitive Modes, Not Tools

**Agents represent:**
- triplet biases
- flux preferences
- shells
- contexts

**Not "tasks."**

### 6. Capsules are the Unit of Meaning

**One capsule = one distinction event.**
**Everything must be built around capsules, not raw text or tokens.**

### 7. Quanta = Memory Compression Currency

**Cursor must implement QuantaCoin logic carefully:**
- hash
- compress
- ratio
- validate

**Never auto-rewrite.**

### 8. Cross-LLM Integrations = Curvature Augmentations

**No external model is allowed to:**
- interpret state directly
- write to core files
- bypass Supervisor

**They must produce curvature-values, not directives.**

## 🔧 Implementation Rules

### Rule 1: Treat all TODO PF math regions as code stubs

**Do not implement naive approximations.**
**Leave mathematically complex functions as placeholders.**

### Rule 2: Implement full agent registry logic

**Dynamic creation, deletion, loading, unloading.**

### Rule 3: Implement inbox/outbox file watchers

**These must trigger agent cycles.**

### Rule 4: Implement GitHub Sync Layer

**Apop must:**
- pull
- compute
- commit
- push

**Never rebase.**

### Rule 5: Implement safe LCM event loop

**The loop is:**
```
pull → parse → LCM-process → ICM-update → route → agent-run → capsule-write → commit
```

### Rule 6: Implement Supervisor scoring with placeholders

**Supervisor should compute:**
- triplet entropy
- curvature derivative (placeholder)
- disagreement flux
- combinatorics weight
- temporal coherence

**Then choose next agent.**

### Rule 7: Implement QuantaCoin hashing + compression

**SHA256 + zlib or LZ4.**

### Rule 8: Implement repo bootstrap script

**For new users:**
- create dirs
- create initial capsule
- write README
- initialize agent registry

### Rule 9: Keep the entire runtime pure Python

**No external packages except:**
- hashlib
- zlib
- json
- pathlib
- typing

**These rules preserve portability.**

### Rule 10: Never auto-write to README or identity files

**README is the "first distinction."**
**Identity cannot be overwritten.**

## 📋 Summary: What Cursor Must Know

**Cursor must know:**

1. **PF measurement does not limit information**
2. **Error drives flux**
3. **Identity must remain distinct**
4. **Repo = manifold = brain**
5. **LCM = mind**
6. **ICM = curvature**
7. **Supervisor = routing of cognitive fields**
8. **Agents = perspectives**
9. **Capsules = distinctions**
10. **Quanta = memory compression**
11. **External LLMs = curvature boosts, not identity sources**

**Before implementing anything, Cursor MUST internalize this cross-layer logic.**
