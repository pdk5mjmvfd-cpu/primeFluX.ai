QuantaCoin (ΦQ) - Utility token for reversible work compression.

QuantaCoin powers the Agora ecosystem:
- Primes = agent IDs (users/families/orgs as classes via PrimeFlux duality)
- Composites = event spaces (transactions hashed into polyforms)
- Ledger compresses exponentially via β-decays and Z-partitions
- Burns fuel spends (e.g., partial $250 Scheels txn)
- Unused balances stake for yields (merch rewards/ΦQ APY)
