"""
Agora Ecosystem - Living, always-compressed colony organism of AI-agent interactions.

Agora = decentralized AI colony where transactions/interactions (burn-to-spend, stake-to-earn)
are event spaces etched into a shrinking ledger. Powered by:
- Primes as agent IDs (users/families/orgs)
- Composites as event spaces (transactions hashed into polyforms)
- QuantaCoin (ΦQ) for deflationary transactions + yields
- PrimeFlux math: β-decays, Z-partitions, π-lift encapsulation
- Ledger shrinks exponentially (not static like Bitcoin)
