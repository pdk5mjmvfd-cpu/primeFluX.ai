# QuantaCoin (ΦQ): Metabolic Energy of the Agora

## What QuantaCoin Is

**QuantaCoin (ΦQ)** is the metabolic energy of the Agora ecosystem—a utility token that measures and preserves human coordination.

### Core Properties

1. **Non-Speculative Utility Token**
   - Measures work done (compression, coordination)
   - Not a security, not a payment for AI
   - Wyoming Series LLC classification: Utility Token

2. **Compression Ledger**
   - Tracks information compression (bloat removed)
   - Every distinction event can mint QuantaCoin
   - Compression ratio = QuantaCoin value

3. **Coordination Score**
   - Measures how much confusion → understanding
   - Tracks fair splits, agreements, schedules
   - Records human-driven coordination events

4. **Reversible Work**
   - Compression is reversible (lossless)
   - Preserves information while reducing bloat
   - Enables audit trail of all coordination

## What QuantaCoin Preserves

### Human Agency
- **No AI can mint without human action**: Every QuantaCoin mint requires a human-initiated event
- **Human-first interfaces**: Terminal, Siri/Shortcuts, simple UIs where human is in the loop
- **Two-key system**: Human + shell must agree for critical actions

### Fair Coordination
- **Measures real coordination**: Only mints when humans successfully coordinate
- **Transparent accounting**: Every mint is auditable in the ledger
- **No hidden optimization**: No ad revenue, engagement metrics, or cost-cutting optimization

### Transparent Accounting
- **Public ledger**: All transactions visible and auditable
- **No speculation**: QuantaCoin is not traded, only earned through work
- **Compression proof**: Every mint backed by measurable compression

## How QuantaCoin Works

### Minting Rules

1. **New Distinction Event**
   - User creates new distinction (new pathway in LCM)
   - System measures compression ratio
   - QuantaCoin minted proportional to compression

2. **Successful Coordination**
   - Humans reach agreement, resolve bill, schedule something
   - System measures cognitive + logistical bloat removed
   - QuantaCoin minted as record of coordination

3. **Pathway Discovery**
   - New LCM pathway discovered (shortcut, habit)
   - Compression achieved through pathway reuse
   - QuantaCoin minted for efficiency gain

### Minting Formula

```
QuantaCoin = compression_ratio × distinction_flux × human_validation
```

Where:
- `compression_ratio`: How much bloat was removed (0.0 to 1.0)
- `distinction_flux`: Magnitude of new distinction (d_phi)
- `human_validation`: Binary (1 if human validated, 0 otherwise)

### Ledger Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1234567890.123,
  "event_type": "distinction_created",
  "compression_ratio": 0.63,
  "distinction_flux": 0.45,
  "quanta_minted": 0.2835,
  "human_validated": true,
  "capsule_hash": "sha256...",
  "pathway": "lcm_shortcut_123"
}
```

## Integration with Ebb/Flow

QuantaCoin minting is tied to Ebb/Flow directives:

- **Explore (Eidos)**: High distinction flux → More QuantaCoin potential
- **Absorb (Praxis)**: Medium distinction flux → Moderate QuantaCoin
- **Create (Aegis)**: Low distinction flux → Validation QuantaCoin

## Integration with Devices

QuantaCoin flow adapts to hardware form factors:

- **Laptops/PCs**: Full exploration → High QuantaCoin potential
- **Phones/Tablets**: Content absorption → Moderate QuantaCoin
- **AirPods/Headphones**: Audio creation → Validation QuantaCoin
- **Cars/Appliances/TVs**: Ambient creation → Background QuantaCoin

## Legal Status

- **Entity**: Wyoming Series LLC (ApopTosis AI LLC)
- **Token**: ΦQ (QuantaCoin)
- **Classification**: Utility Token (non-security)
- **States**: Wyoming, Colorado
- **Compliance**: DAO framework, no CFTC registration for compression work

## Technical Implementation

### Core Modules

- `quanta/` - Core QuantaCoin implementation
- `fluxai/quanta/` - Agora integration
- `core/quanta.py` - PrimeFlux integration
- `runtime/coordinator/` - Ebb/Flow integration

### Key Files

- `quanta/mint.py` - Minting logic
- `quanta/proof.py` - Proof-of-work (compression)
- `fluxai/quanta/quanta_core.py` - Agora sync
- `quanta_ledger/` - Local ledger storage

## Future: Agora Sync

When Agora sync is enabled (opt-in):
- Local ledger syncs to Agora
- QuantaCoin flows between bubbles
- Ecosystem health measured by QuantaCoin flow
- Coordination events visible across Agora

## Philosophy

**QuantaCoin is not money for AI—it's a score of coherent coordination.**

The public narrative:
- Markets can see where real, human-driven coordination is happening
- QuantaCoin is the exhaust of that process
- No AI demands payment—only humans coordinate and compress

This reassures people about jobs:
- No agency without humans
- No substitution of care
- Transparent accounting

*"QuantaCoin measures how much confusion has been converted into shared understanding and fair splits, not how much value the AI captured."*
